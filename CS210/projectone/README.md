## Create two clocks that display 12 and 24 hour format in C++ simultaneously


### Journal Entry - Week 8 Questions

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  - Create two clocks that display 12 and 24 hour format in C++ simultaneously
- What did you do particularly well?
  - Total organization of the code and incode output prompts
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  - Increase total inline comments. Add tests for various parts of the code to verify they work before release. Security audit and risk assessment to search for any vulnerabilities or leaks
- Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  - Overall the previous information from Week 1 and 2 created a decent framework to write the code. 
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  - Organizing my thoughts and mapping out code before approaching the actual coding phase
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - By adding some inline comments to explain various declarations, inheritances, and definitions

## How to run code in Terminal 
### MacOS and Linux only and requires development tools

- git clone repo to your local machine
- `cd SNHU/CS210/projectone`
- `g++ <name-to-give-program> projectone.cpp`
- `./<name-to-give-program>
